# NIST-National-Vulnerability-Database

**This was a part of the final project for AMAT 502 Fall semester in 2021.**

The National Vulnerability Database (NVD) (NIST, 2021b) is a government-created repository hosted by the National Institute of Standards and Technologies (NIST). This repository is widely considered across government agencies and the private sector for its use in automated vulnerability management, security measures, and compliance. Alongside this list of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs), a separate, US-based non- profit organization, the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST), provides a standardized scoring matrix known as the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The CVSS is integrated into the NVD and leverages several crucial factors of the known vulnerabilities to determine their corresponding severity ratings.

This investigation into the CVSS will use supervised and unsupervised Machine Learn- ing (ML) algorithms. The results of this investigation will seek to recreate the human decision-making process for assigning the base vulnerability score for any given vulnera- bility as well as a general scope for label clustering. If time permits, this investigation will look to analyze the text-based descriptions for each vulnerability and cluster common words with the associated vulnerability metrics for a more holistic approach.

This project was initially done by Charles Gilman, Abdelmajid Ihda, Lucy Lee, and Cameron Perry. Each member looked into the dataset using different methods such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Polynomial Regression, Decision Trees using the ID3 Algorithm, and Text Analysis. I, Lucy Lee used PCA and Umap, and here I will process the whole project again with my own insigts.
